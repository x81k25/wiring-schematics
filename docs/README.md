# Database Documentation

This directory contains auto-generated database schema documentation created by `tbls`.

The documentation is automatically updated when changes are made to the database schema via GitHub Actions.

## Generated Files

- Database schema documentation (generated by tbls)
- Entity relationship diagrams (SVG format)
- Table definitions and relationships

## How it Works

1. When migrations are run in the CI/CD pipeline, tbls generates documentation from the test database
2. The documentation is committed back to the repository automatically
3. The documentation is available for review and reference

## Configuration

The tbls configuration is defined in `.tbls.yml` at the project root.
